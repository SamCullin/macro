# Search Processing Service

This service owns the search-event pipeline:

- **Live updates**: the `search-processing-service` Kafka consumer reads the declared entity lifecycle topics and reconciles their OpenSearch documents.
- **Queued work**: SQS workers drain `SEARCH_EVENT_QUEUE` for backfills and legacy producers.
- **Backfills**: internal HTTP endpoints enqueue every indexable record of a given entity type onto SQS.

## Architecture

sps is hexagonal:

```
src/
  domain/                     # indexing/backfill models, ports, and application services
  outbound/                   # Postgres sources, OpenSearch sinks, SQS/Kafka adapters
  api/internal/               # axum handlers — thin pass-throughs to the orchestrator
  inbound/kafka_consumer.rs   # live event decoding, sharded handoff, commits, and retries
  process/                    # indexing shared by the SQS and Kafka inbound adapters
```

The orchestrator is the single inbound contract for HTTP handlers. Swapping an adapter (e.g. in-process → HTTP-proxied owner service) is a wiring change, not a handler rewrite.

## Ingestion Ownership and Event Mapping

Agent-session live events carry only a session UUID on `macro.agent_session_search`. The processor rereads the persisted `agent_session` row and effective `agent_session_log`, applies `agent_fold`, and replaces the parent plus folded-message children in `agent_sessions`. Raw ACP frames are never copied to OpenSearch. SQS uses the same authoritative reconciliation for `POST /internal/backfill/agent-sessions`.

Agent-session invalidations are emitted on creation, rename, deletion, user prompts, history replacement, turn completion, and actor stop. Agent token chunks do not trigger per-chunk indexing; the completed turn is the stable searchable boundary.

Call backfills also remain on SQS, so `POST /internal/backfill/calls` can enqueue call records through the existing path.

The `macro.calls` lifecycle events map to search actions as follows:

| Event | Search action |
|---|---|
| `call.record_archived` | Full upsert of the call and transcript segments |
| `call.record_updated` | Full upsert so edits such as `custom_name` reach search |
| `call.record_summarized` | Full upsert so the generated call name reaches search |
| `call.record_deleted` | Remove the individual call by `call_id` |
| `call.started` | Ignore after decoding |
| `call.recording_ready` | Ignore after decoding |

Upserts read the current call state from Postgres and overwrite the indexed representation, making repeated delivery safe. Kafka events do not carry an index override; reindexing and backfill-specific options belong to the SQS path.

### Kafka Delivery Contract

- The durable consumer group is `search-processing-service`. Its topic list comes from `DeclaredMacroEvent` in `src/inbound/kafka_consumer.rs`.
- The poll loop shards events by entity key across ten bounded sequential workers. Each worker has sixteen waiting slots, so at most 160 handed-off events are buffered.
- Events for the same entity always use one worker. This preserves ordering for a session reconcile followed by its delete while unrelated entities process concurrently.
- An offset is committed asynchronously immediately after a successful in-memory handoff, not after OpenSearch processing. This commit-after-handoff design creates a loss window: a process or host crash can lose already committed buffered events. If the worker channel closes before handoff, the offset is left uncommitted for redelivery.
- Malformed, keyless, and unsupported-schema records are logged and committed without handoff so a poison record cannot wedge a partition. Commit failures are logged and may cause duplicate delivery, which is safe because full upserts and per-call deletes are idempotent.
- Processing gets three total attempts. After the third failure, the event is logged with its entity ID, event type, partition, offset, and final error, then dropped so later events can continue. The backfill endpoint repairs gaps.

## Running Locally

Needs valid AWS credentials (secrets manager + SQS).

Two encrypted env bundles live at the repo root:

- `.env-local.enc` — local backing services via docker-compose.
- `.env-localdev.enc` — dev backing services (dev RDS, dev OpenSearch). Usually what you want for ad-hoc sps work.

`just get_environment <arg>` decrypts `.env-local<arg>.enc` into `.env`. Pass `dev` for the dev-targeting bundle, or no arg for the fully-local one.

```bash
# from repo root — pick one:
just get_environment                 # .env-local.enc       (local services)
just get_environment dev             # .env-localdev.enc    (dev services)
```

The repository already provides a Kafka broker in `docker/docker-compose-databases.yml`. Start it for fully local processing:

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . -f docker/docker-compose-databases.yml up -d kafka
```

Use `KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092` when sps runs directly on the host. A service container attached to the compose `databases` network must use `KAFKA_BROKERS=kafka:29092`; `localhost` inside that container refers to the container itself. Keep the broker value supplied by the dev environment bundle when running against dev infrastructure.

```bash
cd services/search_processing_service

# Fully local host process:
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092 cargo run

# Or, with the dev-targeting environment bundle:
cargo run
```

Override `SEARCH_EVENT_QUEUE` on a per-run basis (e.g. backfills onto a scratch queue) so you don't consume the shared dev queue:

```bash
SEARCH_EVENT_QUEUE=search-event-queue-<scope>-<you> cargo run
```

When `DATABASE_URL_READONLY` is set, backfill reads run against the macrodb read-replica so they do not contend with writes on the primary. The queue workers always read from the primary (replica lag could cause them to miss rows they are meant to index). When the env var is absent, backfills fall back to the primary.

To run the API surface without the SQS or Kafka worker loops:

```bash
cargo run --features disable_processing
```

## Rollout, Monitoring, and Recovery

### Agent sessions

1. Run the OpenSearch index creation helper so `agent_sessions_v1` and the stable `agent_sessions` alias exist.
2. Deploy search-processing with the `macro.agent_session_search` consumer before deploying the harness publisher.
3. Deploy agent-harness. New sessions and stable transcript changes now publish identifier-only invalidations.
4. Start `POST /internal/backfill/agent-sessions` with `{}` and poll the returned job ID. For a blue/green rebuild, pass `{"index_override":"agent_sessions_v2"}` after creating that physical index.
5. Compare the OpenSearch parent count with `agent_session`, monitor Kafka lag and dropped-event logs, and use `{"agent_session_ids":["<uuid>"]}` for targeted repair.

This pass intentionally does not add agent sessions to unified search responses or frontend rendering. When that read path is added, it must filter parent hits through the caller's agent-session access before returning either parent metadata or child highlights; `owner_id` is stored for that purpose but is not itself authorization.

### Calls

1. Configure `KAFKA_BROKERS` and the required MSK read permissions, then deploy the Kafka consumer while the live SQS call producer is still enabled.
2. On the first deployment, the new `search-processing-service` group has no committed offsets, so `auto.offset.reset=earliest` replays the retained `macro.calls` history. This replay and the temporary dual delivery from Kafka and SQS are safe: call upserts are full idempotent overwrites, and deletes are idempotent delete-by-query operations.
3. Before disabling live SQS call publication, confirm the consumer-group lag on `macro.calls` has caught up, worker errors are healthy, and the `call_records` index is fresh. Continue monitoring lag after cutover.
4. Watch service logs for Kafka receive/decode/commit errors, processing retry warnings, events dropped after five attempts, and consumer supervisor restarts. A commit error can result in a safe duplicate; a dropped processing event or crash in the commit-after-handoff window can require recovery.

For the local broker, inspect group lag with:

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . -f docker/docker-compose-databases.yml exec kafka \
  /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 \
  --group search-processing-service \
  --describe
```

During the dual-delivery window, rollback the consumer deployment while SQS continues to provide live call indexing. After the SQS producer has been disabled, first roll back that producer change to resume SQS delivery, then roll back the consumer if needed.

Use `POST /internal/backfill/calls` after a rollback, a dropped upsert, or a suspected transition gap. An empty body re-enqueues every archived call through SQS; `{"call_ids": ["<uuid>"]}` targets known calls. This restores existing call documents but does not synthesize a delete event for a call that no longer exists, so investigate dropped delete logs by call ID.

## Backfill HTTP Routes

Every search-indexed entity has a POST endpoint on sps's internal surface. A POST returns `202 Accepted` with `{"job_id":"..."}`; poll `GET /internal/backfill/{job_id}` for progress and completion. Routes share internal-auth via the `x-internal-auth-key` header and accept a per-entity JSON filter in the request body.

| Entity | Route | Body (all fields optional) |
|---|---|---|
| Agent sessions | `POST /internal/backfill/agent-sessions` | `{"agent_session_ids": ["<uuid>"], "modified_after": "...", "modified_before": "...", "index_override": "agent_sessions_v2"}` — empty IDs = all sessions |
| Calls | `POST /internal/backfill/calls` | `{"call_ids": ["<uuid>"]}` — empty = all archived calls |
| Chats | `POST /internal/backfill/chats` | `{"chat_ids": [...], "user_ids": [...]}` |
| Channels | `POST /internal/backfill/channels` | `{}` |
| Documents | `POST /internal/backfill/documents` | `{"file_types": ["pdf"], "sub_type": "task", "created_after": "...", "created_before": "..."}` |
| Emails | `POST /internal/backfill/emails` | `{"since": "2026-03-16T00:00:00Z", "index_override": "emails_v2", "batch_size": 100}` |

### Against dev (deployed service)

```bash
AUTH_KEY=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
  --secret-id document-storage-service-auth-key-dev \
  --region us-east-1 --query SecretString --output text)

curl -X POST https://search-processing-dev.macro.com/internal/backfill/calls \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-internal-auth-key: $AUTH_KEY" \
  -d '{}'
```

Dev sps consumes the shared `search-event-queue-dev`; backfill messages will interleave with normal ingest. If the deploy brings a mapping change, recreate the relevant index (via `infra/stacks/opensearch/helpers/scripts/create_indices.ts`) before triggering the backfill so stale-mapping docs don't linger.

Monitor: `aws sqs get-queue-attributes` on the dev queue, `GET <dev-opensearch>/<index>/_count`, and CloudWatch logs for the `search-processing-dev` ECS task.

### Pre-shipping: validate with a local service + scratch queue

```bash
aws sqs create-queue --queue-name search-event-queue-<scope>-<you> --region us-east-1

# shell 1
just get_environment dev
cd services/search_processing_service
SEARCH_EVENT_QUEUE=search-event-queue-<scope>-<you> cargo run

# shell 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/internal/backfill/calls \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-internal-auth-key: local" \
  -d '{}'

aws sqs delete-queue --queue-url <scratch-queue-url> --region us-east-1
```
